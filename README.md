# Laser-Security-System
Laser Security System implemented with Watchdog algorithm

The algorithm is written in C and the circuit is hand built. The project is completed under the collaborated effort of me and
two other friends.

The Laser Security System has two lasers pointing at two photodiodes. The algorithm records the number of breakage of the
laser beams and calculates the number of "enter"s and "exit"s. The watchdog algorithm implemented keeps the program running
when it hits the preset amount of time.
